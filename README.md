# FinTechProj1
### The objective of this project is to optimize one's portfolio using Monte Carlo Simulations and historical data from Alpacas spanning the past 20 years.

All parts of the Project completed by Donya Ahmadi

## Part 1 - Data (Collection, CleanUp, etc.)
### The first part included importing necessary libraries, initializing variables (including env), and importing historical data using Alpacas API. For this project, I chose AAPL, AMZN, AND MSFT, but any ticker will work. 
## Part 2 - Monte Carlo Simulations
## Part 3 - Portfolio Optimization
## Part 4 - Data Visualization
