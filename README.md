# FinTechProj1
### The objective of this project is to optimize one's portfolio using Monte Carlo Simulations and historical data from Alpacas spanning the past 20 years.

All parts of the Project completed by Donya Ahmadi

## Part 1 - Data (Collection, CleanUp, etc.)
### The first part included importing necessary libraries, initializing variables (including env), and importing historical data using Alpacas API. For this project, I chose AAPL, AMZN, AND MSFT, but any ticker will work. I displayed the daily return, mean, standard deviation, and last-day closing prices for my chosen tickers and the S&P 500.
## Part 2 - Monte Carlo Simulations
### A Monte Carlo simulation is a computational technique that uses random sampling to model and analyze complex systems or processes. In my code, I run 50 (can be changed) Monte Carlo simulations to optimize a portfolio's asset allocation based on historical stock data, aiming to maximize the Sharpe ratio. The results include optimal weights for each stock, the cumulative returns of the optimized portfolio, and a benchmark (S&P 500)
## Part 3 - Portfolio Optimization
## Part 4 - Data Visualization
